## SLIDE 1: Cover / Title Slide

**Visual Style:** Dark gradient background (purple to blue), premium glass effect, centered logo

### Content:
```
MELODEX
The Universal Creative IP Registry

Turning Every Creative Work Into 
Monetizable, Tradable Assets

Built on Story Protocol
Buildathon Checkpoint 2 | December 2025
```

**Design Elements:**
- Large Melodex logo (music note + blockchain icon)
- Subtle animated particles/stars in background
- Story Protocol badge in corner
- Clean, modern typography (SF Pro or Inter)

**Speaker Notes:**
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm here to show you Melodex - the platform that's solving the $200 billion problem in creative IP ownership. We've built the first universal registry where artists, musicians, writers, and designers can mint, license, and monetize any creative work in under 3 minutes."

## SLIDE 2: The Problem - A $2.9 Trillion Market in Crisis

**Visual Style:** Split-screen with problem icons on left, stats on right

### Content:
```
THE PROBLEM: CREATORS ARE LOSING BILLIONS

70%     of indie creators earn < minimum wage
$200B   lost annually to IP theft & unclear ownership  
45 days average to clear rights for commercial use
$5,000+ legal costs to register a single IP asset

Traditional systems are:
❌ Slow (weeks to months)
❌ Expensive ($5k-$15k per registration)
❌ Fragmented (music ≠ art ≠ stories)
❌ Centralized (platforms take 70-85%)
```

**Design Elements:**
- Big bold numbers in gradient text
- Icons: broken chain, hourglass, dollar sign with X, sad face
- Dark red/orange color scheme for "crisis" feel
- Timeline graphic showing 45-day licensing process

**Speaker Notes:**
"The creative economy is massive - $2.9 trillion globally - but it's fundamentally broken. 70% of independent creators can't even make minimum wage because intermediaries capture most of the value. It takes 45 days on average to clear music rights for a video game or commercial. And legal fees for IP registration cost $5,000 to $15,000 per asset. This isn't just inefficient - it's crushing creativity."

## SLIDE 4: How It Works - Creator Flow

**Visual Style:** Step-by-step visual with screenshots

### Content:
```
CREATOR JOURNEY (3 MINUTES)

1️⃣ CONNECT WALLET
   MetaMask • WalletConnect • Coinbase Wallet
   
2️⃣ UPLOAD CONTENT
   Drag & drop any file (MP3, JPG, PDF, MP4)
   
3️⃣ AI ENHANCEMENT (Optional)
   "Generate album art: cyberpunk musician"
   → Stability AI creates 1024x1024 artwork in 10 seconds
   
4️⃣ REGISTER IP
   One-click → IPFS upload + Story Protocol mint
   
5️⃣ GET PROOF
   Immutable certificate with IP ID + transaction hash
```

**Design Elements:**
- Large numbered steps with arrows flowing downward
- Screenshot of each step (wallet modal, upload UI, AI generation, success message)
- Progress bar showing 3-minute timeline
- Before/after for AI artwork generation

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let me show you how simple this is. Step 1: Connect your wallet - we support all major providers. Step 2: Upload your file - just drag and drop. Step 3: Optionally use our AI to generate professional artwork in 10 seconds. Step 4: Click 'Register IP' and we handle everything - IPFS upload, metadata creation, Story Protocol minting. Step 5: You get an immutable certificate of ownership. Total time? 3 minutes. Compare that to 45 days with traditional systems."
